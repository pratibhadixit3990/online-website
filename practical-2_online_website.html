    <h2 style="color: brown;"><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p style="color:darkred;">My name is <b><i><u>Pratibha Dixit</u></i></b>. I am pursuing my B.Tech. from <q>Computer Science and Engineering</q>.
        I want to learn more about computers and more specifically I like to code.
        My strengths are my positive thoughts and my positive mental attitude about each and everything around me.
        Currently, after the introduction of Fullstack in my curriculum I am looking forward to learn about the
        different aspects of web-development. I am a firm believer that what makes a programmer a developer is the
        desire to expand his or her bubble of knowledge to learn more and more and to conatantly update their skill set and
        technicals. Meaning one needs to be ready all the time to learn and explore about the new technologies around him or her.

    <!--In the above body we can use align attribute with h1, h2 and p to set the alignment of the above text
    to left, right, center or justify. But the align attribute is depriciated in HTML5 meaning that we can
    use it but it is not advisable to use it. So, if we want to give alignment than we can use CSS for this purpose
    now by using style="text-align:_________" from which we can align the text in either left, right, center or
    justify it.-->

    <!--In the above we have used:
    b->it makes the text Bold
    i->it make the text in Italics
    q->it is used to enclose the text in Double Quotes
    u->it is used to underline the text-->
